          In ancient times, namely before 1981, Tambaksari Village, had not yet become a Village Government and was still integrated with Tambaksumur Village which was under the sub-district of Batujaya, and was headed by a Village Head because the area was very wide, so in 1981 Tambaksumur Village was divided or divided into two villages, namely Tambaksumur Village and Tambaksari Village for Tambaksari Village led by Village Head H.M. SUHERI, from 1981 to 2001, while from 2001 to the present led by Village Head M. Arum. The fundamental reason why Tambaksari Village was divided into two villages was to equalize each region and to maximize services to the community. The expansion of Tambaksari Village occurred in 1981.
